###### Each year, our Chapter votes on the most urgent issues we believe deserve our collective energy and focus. As our membership continues to grow, we are prioritizing the following areas:

***

## Establishing a Tenet Union

Members of the Flint Hills DSA are working on revitalizing [Renters Together MHK](https://www.renterstogether.org/), a tenet union located in Manhattan, KS.

## Palestine Solidarity

The Flint Hills DSA has a working group to promote awareness around the genocide of the Palestinian people in Gaza and in the West Bank, by the Israeli government. To learn more, check out the committees and working groups page.
