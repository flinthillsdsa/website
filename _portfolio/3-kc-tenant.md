### WE HAVE A DEAL


#### VICTORY AT INDEPENDENCE TOWERS AFTER EIGHT MONTHS ON RENT STRIKE


Yesterday, eight months into their rent strike, Independence Towers Tenant Union held a two-hour bargaining session with their new landlord, Vijai Ponnezhan of Dynasty Properties.
The bargaining resulted in a signed agreement which ensures that all current residents will receive new leases, rent will be set at rates negotiated with the tenant union, there will be no retaliation for organizing, and major repairs will be completed by November 2025.
Since October 2024, the majority of Independence Towers tenants have been on rent strike- the longest and largest in regional history- withholding over $289,672; the tenants will not pay a dollar of back rent.
Yesterday's agreement, which satisfies key union demands, allows the union to consider de-escalating from strike and resuming rent payments in June. The union will meet tonight to formalize this decision.
AGREEMENT DETAILS:

‚ÄºÔ∏èEvery current tenant will get a one year lease with an option to make it two‚Äîwith a rent increase cap at 5% for year two. 

‚ÄºÔ∏èRent and utilities rates frozen at essentially current levels‚Äîwill actually reduce for some. New tenants at the same rates.

‚ÄºÔ∏è$75 automatic monthly utility discount till HVAC fully repaired.

‚ÄºÔ∏èNo retaliation for organizing, recognition of tenant union.

‚ÄºÔ∏èSchedule for conditions and common space fixes, including pest extermination, plumbing repair, and parking garage reopening.

‚ÄºÔ∏èFull HVAC repaired by November.

‚ÄºÔ∏èCommitment to renegotiate with the union at the end of the lease term.
