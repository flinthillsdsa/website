###### Each year, the Chapter takes a vote on the most pressing matters for which we would like to put our collective engergy toward organizing and mobilizing. Given our growing numbers, we are prioritizing the following:

***

## Establishing a Tenet Union

Members of the Flint Hills DSA are working on revitalizing [Renters Together MHK](https://www.renterstogether.org/), a tenet union located in Manhattan, KS.

## Palestine Solidarity

The Flint Hills DSA has a working group to promote awareness around the genocide of the Palestinian people in Gaza and in the West Bank, by the Israeli government. To learn more, check out the committees and working groups page.
