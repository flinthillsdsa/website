About the presenter: Luisa M. is a member of DSAâ€™s National Political Committee, union organizer, and formerly undocumented immigrant who is speaking with chapters about the immigrant justice movement. This Red Talk will cover the history of deportation as a means of political control, and past and current crackdowns and how DSA can become a national leader in the movement. There will also be time for Q&A and a group discussion about how we can support communities in Kansas.
