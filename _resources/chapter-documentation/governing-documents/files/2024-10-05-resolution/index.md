# Resolution: A Principled Anti-Zionist Flint Hills DSA

***

Resolution #, October 5, 2024

***

**Whereas**, Zionism is a fascist settler-colonialist ideology that requires the displacement, persecution, or destruction of Palestinians and Palestinian lives, in accordance with the tactics of apartheid South Africa and American colonialism, as it has done for more than 75 years;

**Whereas**, Zionism is first and foremost a project centered around the seizure of land and not the freedom of religion, as evidenced by Israeli persecution of Palestinian and non-Palestinian communities, groups, and individuals of Muslim, Jewish, and Christian faiths;

**Whereas**, Zionism and the Israeli settler project seek to create an ethnostate, as evidenced by its caste-based structure and mistreatment of Arab, Palestinian, and African Jews living within Israel;

**Whereas**, Zionism and the Israeli settler project threaten to destabilize the region by continuing to target Palestine, Lebanon, Syria, and other neighboring countries, particularly in a manner that violates the Geneva Conventions and other international law;

**Whereas**, the Israeli Occupation Forces have killed and ethnically cleansed millions of Palestinians in the span of less than a year;

**Whereas**, Zionism and the Israeli settler project seek to spread misinformation regarding the actions and activities of resistance groups set against it, while obfuscating their own illegal activities;

**Whereas**, espousing anti-Zionist views is not a tacit endorsement of anti-Semitic ones, and is rather a reflection of a principled and consistent worldview, and that Zionism itself is anti-Semitic by insinuating that there is no way for Jews to be made safe throughout the world, and attempting to tie all Jewish identity to the illegal settler project;

**Whereas**, our commitments to Socialism and anti-Zionism demand our solidarity with occupied peoples across the world, and resistance to fascism in all its forms; demands our support for the Palestinian’s right to return; and demands our support for their resistance in whatever form it takes \- as is consistent with well-established international law;

**Whereas**, the Flint Hill DSA believes the national body has failed in its duty as socialists to take a principled stance against Zionism, even after passing its own resolution claiming to do so;

**Whereas**, the Flint Hill DSA believes that the United States government is in violation of international law in its financial and material support for the genocide of Palestinians, its refusal to action arrest warrants against key members of the Israeli regime, and its unwillingness to leverage an arms embargo or other diplomatic tactics to force Israeli negotiators to accept an end to their illegal activities;

**Therefore, be it resolved,** the Flint Hills DSA must align itself with the **Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions** (BDS) Movement, as well as the the **Palestinian Youth Movement** (PYM), **Palestinian Youth Organization**, **Progressive Student Labor Front**, and countless other organizations that have requested our [solidarity](https://palestinianyouthmovement.com/support-dsa-working-group) \- in accordance with their wishes, our chapter must refrain from financially supporting companies that benefit from or contribute to the Zionist settler project;

**Be it resolved**, the Flint Hills DSA will never endorse political candidates at any level of state or federal government that is known to be a Zionist or align with Zionist ideology, and will rescind any endorsements of candidates should these views be disclosed following that decision;

**Be it resolved**, the Flint Hills DSA will *only* endorse political candidates on the grounds of principled anti-Zionism if said candidates support or pledge to support legislation that would enact an arms embargo, divest American taxpayer dollars or local, state, or federal funds from the Zionist settler project, condemn illegal Israeli settler activity, including but not limited to genocide, ethnic cleansing, false imprisonment, systematic rape, and occupation \- or otherwise oppose legislation that would endorse any of this activity;

**Be it further resolved**, the Flint Hills DSA will make concerted efforts to inform and educate its members, the public, and political candidates seeking endorsement on the history of Palestine and Zionism;

**Be it further resolved**, that membership within the Flint Hills DSA is contingent on the following: 

1. Members must condemn Zionism in both theory and praxis  
2. Members must recognize that anti-Zionism is not indicative of anti-Semitism and must oppose attempts to alter either definition so as to conflate the two  
3. Members must not knowingly financially or materially support Israel’s economy or government  
4. Members shall not hold affiliation with the Zionist settler project, lobbyist groups such as AIPAC, or right-wing groups and organizations that have expressed Zionist views such as Turning Point USA
