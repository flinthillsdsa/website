#### V. Open issues

- Improving the organization of Flint Hills DSA update:
  - We have more established roles that need filling
  - We now have a sign up sheet
  - We (or Noah) will be following more strict meeting procedures laid out by the agenda
- KC Tenants collaboration update:
  - We were not able to get the link to the KC Tenant in meeting so we were not able to coordinate with their leadership and collaborate on their rent strike campaign
  - We were invited to sign up for updates to the Federation of Tenant Unions and KC Tenants are aware that we are willing to collaborate with them
- Tenant Advocacy and our work meeting:
  - We scheduled and hosted a work meeting to better understand the tenant situation and what we need to do to help tenants see the working meeting guide: [Work Meeting Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ttq_IzaCcEfjXdgGgZrGEdUMRYFfXKN4SpVKe4T_2BE/edit?tab=t.mo9lova3lo90)

#### VI. New Business

- Electoral Strategy 101: What is the DSA Difference
  - We, along with Milo Pomarico are hosting "Electoral Strategy 101: What is the DSA Difference" next week to discuss electoral strategy as a socialist and how to run campaigns that improve the conditions of the working class
- 1-on-1s
  - 1-on-1s better help individual members understand what is going on with Flint Hills DSA, answer any questions, address any concerns, and ultimately to help direct the member in the right direction in accessing knowledge, experience, tools, and organizing opportunities.
- Racial Trauma Healing
  - Peter has been in contact with an antiracism educator, Kokayi Nosakhere, ahead of a Wichita event that got canceled due to the organizers pulling out. His events are primarily about building the skill sets to create what he calls a Racial Trauma Healing Center, which for us would mean having the capacity to work through any remaining biases and preconceived notions we might have and help other people do the same. Paired with the success we've had recently with helping tenants, the free store, etc., I think we'll be positioned to do some serious good. If you're not sure about this or want to learn more, there's an online event on January 20th. Peter has been in contact and considering the idea of inviting them to Manhattan.
- Housing & Tenant issues
  - Amber, Steve, and friend helping prevent tenant from being evicted
    - Amber, Steve, and Steve’s roommate Aaron was recognized for their actions of preventing a tenant from being evicted from her home. They brought her home up to code by making repairs to her porch and cleaned up her yard.
   - Code Enforcement collaboration
     - Amber has been in contact with Manhattan Code Enforcement and they are willing to work with Renters Together MHK (operated by our members) and individual tenants
  - Tenant canvas outreach plan
    - We need one more work meeting to “tie loose ends” and finish any last minute planning
  - Nick Blessing
    - Nick Blessing is a tenant attorney that reached out to Renters Together MHK and is will to work with Renters Together and any tenant in helping to provide legal advice and represent tenants in eviction court
- Creating an annual calendar for work meetings and events
  - We agreed that we would benefit from an annual calendar with all of Flint Hills DSA’s major events and meetings scheduled out for the year in advance. We will be working with Gwen and the rest of the steering committee to put together a calendar for the year
- Coalition with Indivisible and other orgs
  - We agreed it is good to form coalitions with other orgs in Manhattan so long as we do not sacrifice our values and principals. It is incredibly important to form relationships with individuals, coalitions with organizations, and a broad leftist movement in the Flint Hills in order to effectively combat fascism
